I attemped to pull in twitter feed using client.js (the node server, with the twitter client)

I then wrote the front end using webpack, with a store and action using alt, the flux implementation.
I had used bootstrap css for laying out the page.

I was getting loader errors when using twitter in the action file.

Overall, not very successful, mainly because Im not well versed with the configurations using the different packages together.

Thanks for reading,
